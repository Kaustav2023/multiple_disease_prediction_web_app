# Multiple_disease_prediction_web_app
The project is a multiple disease prediction web app built using Streamlit, pickle, and Python. It is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and allows users to predict whether a person has diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease based on the respective input data provided to the machine learning models.

The dataset used for the prediction models were sourced from Kaggle (find the documentation regarding the dataset in the repository). These datasets were preprocessed and used to train machine learning models. The models were then saved using pickle for later use in the web app.

The web app interface provides users with input fields where they can enter relevant information such as age, gender, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc., depending on the disease being predicted. Once the user submits the input, the app uses the trained machine learning models to make predictions and displays the results to the user.

The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to quickly assess their risk of having one of these diseases based on their input data. This can be helpful for early detection and prevention of these diseases.
